                    Establishment of armed forces and military institutions On 2 July 1992 a Presidential Decree established a Ministry of Defence to supersede the Ministry of Defence Affairs. Over the succeeding years, Uzbekistan replaced Russian officers with ethnic Uzbeks
                    and restructured the military to focus on targets like civil unrest, drug trafficking, and Hizb-ut-Tahrir.[citation needed] The three major Soviet military academies, the Tashkent Higher All-Arms Command School, the Chirchiq Higher
                    Tank Command and Engineering School, and the Samarkand Higher Military Automobile Command School, were located in Uzbekistan. This caused the government to not send Uzbek officers to Russia for training. In 1994, they established the
                    joint Armed Forces Academy, to train officers of all branches. Though the Uzbek language was becoming more in use by the army, Russian remained the main language used in training officers, due to the fact that most manuals were in
                    Russian. But today Uzbek language is used in all spheres of defense system as it is an only state language in Uzbekistan[7] ..more..

                    Our grandfather Amir Temur, the great commander, meant exactly this truth when he said: "The bravest of soldiers will be mighty." I repeatedly emphasize that every soldier, every guard of the Motherland should know deeply the teachings of Amir Temur and
                    our great commanders, their military legacy. Even today, this immortal and priceless heritage gives infinite pride to the hearts of each of us and strengthens the feelings of loyalty to our holy land.
